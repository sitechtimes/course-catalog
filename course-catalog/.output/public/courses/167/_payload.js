The course also grants the students CUNY - College of Staten Island credit for ENS 110 - Engineering Graphics provided students take other CTE courses in our school before graduating.

This is due to the students working on their OWN INDEPENDENT TRACK of projects in one of the programs above. If the tracks do not fit the student, then they and the instructor can craft a new track that still uses one of the main CAD software experiences. During the course of the year students regularly conference with the instructor, who grades them based on progress that is positive and timely, based on their status during the previous conference. Grades are NOT from completed projects because projects will vary wildly in scale for each student. During project design, the students are required to maintain a LIVE design document that is shared with the instructor. This is where communication takes place in between conferences and notes are added during conferences. The contents of this LIVE document will evolve into being a narrative of the student's work complete with pictures and other media into an online portfolio where the students can speak to their design process with precision because of the documentation.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EThere is NO homework other than the students desires to research for their projects and prepare resources.

Student discussions will focus on how these various forms can serve various purposes - as a Factual Record, to Convey Atmosphere, as an Analogy, and as a lesson in Historiography. Because the dramatic form used in art requires consistent and relatively simple motivational interpretations, students can often learn how the time period in which the film was made interpreted historical personalities and events. Culturally responsive selections will expand students&rsquo; understanding of their own culture as well as the many cultures in the story of the United States. Each foundational piece of artwork for a particular unit will comprise three levels of investigation and analysis. The first level will be researching the contextualization of the art: When was it created, what period is it meant to reflect, and how is the creator&rsquo;s own experiences reflected in the product. Such analysis is similar to the HIPP analysis done by history students in Staten Island Tech in the AP World course from 9th and 10th grade. The second level will be viewing\u002Flistening to the source material, requiring engaging class discussion and debate on the messages, emotions, and stories conveyed through the art.

Problem situations may result in all types of linear equations in one variable, quadratic functions, exponential functions and operations using polynomials. Problem situations resulting in systems of equations will also be presented. Measurement within a problem-solving context will include calculating rates using appropriate units and converting within measurement systems. Data analysis including measures of central tendency and visual representations of data, in addition to an understanding of correlation and causation and regression equations will be explored.

This course is meant to employ an integrated approach to the study of geometric relationships. Integrating synthetic, transformational, and coordinate approaches to geometry, students will justify geometric relationships and properties of geometric figures.&nbsp; Congruence and similarity of triangles will be established using&nbsp; appropriate theorems. Transformations including rotations, reflections, translations, and glide reflections and coordinate geometry will be used to establish and verify geometric relationships. A major emphasis of this course is to allow students to investigate geometric situations. Properties of triangles, quadrilaterals, and circles should receive particular attention. It is intended that students will use the traditional tools of compass and straightedge as well as dynamic geometry software that models these tools more efficiently and accurately, to assist in these investigations.

Within this course, the number system will be extended to include imaginary and complex numbers. The families of functions to be studied will include polynomial, absolute value, radical, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Problems resulting in systems of equations will be solved graphically and algebraically including 3 variable systems. Algebraic techniques will be developed to facilitate rewriting mathematical expressions into multiple equivalent forms. Data analysis will be extended to include measures of dispersion and the analysis of regression that models functions are studied throughout this course. Arithmetic and geometric sequences will be expressed in multiple forms, and arithmetic and geometric series will be evaluated.

Most students who enroll in the equivalent of this course in college are usually interested in further study of biology or medicine. There is less emphasis on breadth of content coverage and more emphasis on in-depth conceptual understanding and science practices. As a result, this course requires students to spend more time on inquiry based learning of concepts and development of scientific reasoning skills such as formulating a scientific argument, analyzing case studies, designing a plan for collecting data, analyzing data, applying statistical tests, and connecting concepts across disciplines. SITHS&rsquo;s goal is to engage students in learning biology so that this course becomes a positive component of their high school experience, that not only prepares them for more advanced study in biology (if they choose to pursue that) but also enriches their life.&nbsp; Because we emphasize USING facts about biology rather than memorizing information, SITHS hopes the teaching methods&nbsp; used will significantly change the way students view the world.&nbsp; Sometimes students will practice applying the material alone, and sometimes students will do so with members of their learning team.&nbsp; SITHS wants to foster an interest in biology that continues beyond the date of the final exam, prepares students to make effective choices in the voting booth, enables students to be citizens of the world, and helps them acquire skills that can be used in other endeavors.&nbsp; The sequence of topics is as follows: scientific inquiry, ecology and plant biology, biochemistry, energy and cells, genetics, evolution, and human anatomy and physiology.

The course will also focus on the craft of composition and skills required for the SAT examination, the English Common Core Regents and writing products that meet the ELA Common Core State Standards.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECollege Russian (Grade 11) \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Ec\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003Eulminates in the NEWL (National Examination in World Languages) exam.

Students discuss and learn various areas of math, from elementary to very advanced, college level mathematics. Every meeting is filled with rich topics for discussion in various areas of mathematics. Topics will range from history, philosophy, and math education to the discussion and study of particular areas of math. Students problem solve for both remedial and advanced areas of mathematics. Problem solving sessions can range from subjects like high school algebra and geometry to college level courses such as calculus, statistics, analysis, abstract algebra, and much more. Some of the subjects covered in the Math Team are: Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Number Theory, Topology, Combinatorics, Probability, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Advanced Euclidean Geometry, Mathematics Education. The Math Team is also a great opportunity to meet other fellow math enthusiasts, and to make friends, to socialize and to have fun. Math Team is an elective course and meets 4-5 times a week during the school day. The Team participates in New York City Interscholastic Math League(NYCIML), the New York Mathematics League(NYML), American Mathematics Competitions (AMC 10\u002F12), Purple Comet and TrinMac.&nbsp; The school also competes in the Downtown Mathematics Invitational at Stuyvesant HS, South Brooklyn Invitational Mathematics Competition at FDR HS and the Staten Island Mathematics Competition at SITHS.&nbsp; We also organize and run District 31&rsquo;s Elementary and Middle School Math Competitions.\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E","CAREER","AP Comp Sci Principles T1","\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003EContinues the track started in Freshmen Band, by applying note-reading skills, musicianship, rehearsal techniques to increasingly challenging literature.
